Synthesis of Diaminoglyoxime from Glyoxal (These procedures are very detailed to make sure time is 
saved when working on it. The more detail put on this “LAB NOTES” the less redo you need to suffer in the future. Make sure you read them carefully before startinh.


First step
- Dissolve 140g (3.5mol) of sodium hydroxide into 400mL of water in a 1L three-neck flask.
- Place the three-neck flask in an ice-water bath and stir continuously.
- Gradually add 222g (3.2mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 3 portions, with continuous 
stirring.
- To the still-cold solution, add 116g (0.8mol) of 40% (likely a chemical you want to specify, such 
as glyoxal or another reagent).
- During this step, it is critical to keep the temperature of the three-neck flask between 0°C and 
20°C to prevent over-reacting.
• Preparation of Potassium Hydroxide Solution:
- Dissolve 9 g of potassium hydroxide (KOH) into 76mL of water. Stir until the potassium hydroxide 
is fully dissolved.
• Preparation of Reaction Mixture:
- In a stainless-steel reactor, add 24g of diaminoglyoxime. The reactor should be made from welded 
stainless steel water pipe fittings and have a capacity of 270mL.
• Heating the Reactor:
- Pour the potassium hydroxide solution over the diaminoglyoxime in the reactor.
- Immerse the reactor in oil and begin heating it. The temperature should be raised to 180°C over 
a period of 30 minutes.
- Once the target temperature (180°C) is reached, maintain the reactor at this temperature for 2 
hours. Keep the temperature range between 170-180°C.
• Cooling and Pressure Release:
- After 2 hours, turn off the hotplate and allow the reactor to cool slowly to room temperature.
• Opening the Reactor:
- Once the reactor has cooled, open it carefully. Expect a small amount of pressure to be released.
- The solution inside will have a strong ammonia smell, indicating the reaction has occurred.
• Crystallization and Filtration:
- Small white needle-like crystals will have precipitated out of the solution.
- Filter the crystals to isolate them from the liquid.

• Drying the Crystals:
- Wash the crystals, if necessary, and then dry them thoroughly.
• Yield and Bottling:
- After drying, weigh the recovered crystals. The final yield of diaminofurazan (DAF) should be 8.6 
g, corresponding to a yield of 42%.
• Preparation of Reactants:
- Measure 15 g of 50% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) into a clean container.
- Add 10 g of crushed ice to the hydrogen peroxide solution.
• Addition of Sulfuric Acid:
- Slowly drip 14 g of concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) into the mixture while carefully maintaining 
the temperature below 20°C. Stir gently if necessary to ensure the acid is evenly distributed.
• Preparation of Diaminofurazan (DAF) Suspension:
- In a separate 80mL beaker, add 2.5g of diaminofurazan (DAF) to the container.
• Mixing and Reaction Initiation:
- Gradually pour the prepared hydrogen peroxide, ice, and sulfuric acid mixture over the 
diaminofurazan in the beaker.
- Stir the mixture using a drill press (or mechanical stirrer) to facilitate dissolution of the 
diaminofurazan.
- As the reaction occurs, a green color will form due to the soluble nitroso compound.
• Observation of Color Change:
- After approximately one hour, observe the green color slowly turning to orange. This indicates the 
formation of a fine precipitate of diaminofurazan azine (DAAF).
• Stirring Period:
- Continue stirring the suspension for an additional 9 hours.
• Further Reaction Time:
- Leave the suspension undisturbed for an additional 15 hours, completing a total reaction time of 
24 hours.
• Dilution and Filtration:
- After 24 hours, dilute the reaction mixture with an equal volume of water.
- Filter the suspension to recover the fine orange crystals of DAAF.
• Washing and Drying:
- Wash the collected orange crystals with 200 mL of cold water to remove any impurities.
- Dry the crystals thoroughly.
• Yield and Bottling:
- After drying, weigh the recovered product. 
• Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide Solution:
- Measure 27.5g of 50% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and pour it into a 250mL conical beaker.
- Add 17.5mL of water to dilute the hydrogen peroxide solution.
- Chill the mixture in an ice bath or in a freezer until it reaches a temperature of 5°C.
• Dissolution of Ammonium Persulfate:
- Weigh 30g of ammonium persulfate and dissolve it completely into the chilled hydrogen peroxide 
solution in the beaker.
- Once dissolved, place the beaker back into the freezer to cool further.
- Preparation of DAAF Solution(anticipated):
- In a separate container, weigh 2.5g of (DAAF).
- Add the DAAF to 32g of 98% sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
- Stir the mixture gently until the DAAF is fully dissolved into the sulfuric acid.
- Addition of DAAF Solution to Peroxide Solution:
- Once the DAAF solution is ready, slowly and carefully add it to the cooled hydrogen peroxide and 
ammonium persulfate solution.
- During the addition, ensure that the temperature of the solution is maintained below 20°C.
- As the DAAF solution is added, you will observe the formation of a very fine orange suspension, 
indicating that the DAAF is precipitating.
• Heating the Reaction Mixture:
- After the addition is complete, transfer the beaker to an oil bath preheated to 40°C.
- Stir the reaction mixture continuously using a drill press or mechanical stirrer.
11
- Make sure to maintain good stirring to churn the foam formed during the oxidation process.
- Continue heating and stirring the mixture for 8 hours, observing the color change of the solution 
from orange to bright yellow as the reaction progresses.
• Quenching the Reaction:
- After 8 hours, carefully remove the beaker from the oil bath.
- Pour the reaction mixture into 200mL of ice-cold water to quench the reaction and precipitate the 
product.
• Filtration and Washing:
- Filter the precipitate to isolate the yellow solid.
- Wash the filtered solid with additional water to remove any residual impurities.
• Extraction with Dichloromethane (DCM):
- Dissolve the washed yellow solid into 150mL of dichloromethane (DCM).
- Stir the DCM solution and then wash it with a dilute sodium bicarbonate solution (NaHCO₃ in 
water) to neutralize any acidic impurities.
- Separate the yellow DCM solution from the aqueous layer.
• Evaporation and Isolation of Product:
- Transfer the yellow DCM solution to a suitable container and evaporate the solvent under reduced 
pressure or in a well-ventilated area to yield the yellow crystals of DNAF.
• Final Product:
- After evaporation, the remaining yellow solid is the desired product, DNAF. Ensure that the 
crystals are dried completely before storing.
